/*
 * So how do themes work?
 *
 * Themes DECLARE objects (groups of parts) inside a 'collections' section.
 * Each of these groups are an element of a theme - much like an image in a
 * web page with <img src=blah.jpg>, but MUCH more powerful. They can scale
 * without just being stretched or tiled, they can react to all sorts of events
 * from the user (mouse for example) or other logical events (like being shown
 * or hidden, etc.) or synthetic signals from enlightenment itself indicating
 * some new state.
 *
 * Each group is split into a parts section that contains all the elements
 * that make up that group, and how they are laid out. Each part can have
 * multiple states - described in description sections. There must always be
 * at least a default description of value 0.0. After this there may possibly
 * be a programs section. This defines behavior and how the group will react
 * to events/signals.
 *
 * A theme is simply made up of a LOT of these. If a group is not provided in
 * the theme you are using, it will fall back to the default theme to get the
 * element. It is assumed the default theme is 100% complete and provides
 * everything E needs. If this is not the case, there will be problems, so
 * replace the default theme with great care. As long as the theme you make is
 * just a normal "overlay" (and falls back to the default where things are
 * missing) Things will be fairly safe. If you want to make a full default
 * replacement you will need to methodically go through all of this file
 * and make sure you have replaced/provided everything here.
