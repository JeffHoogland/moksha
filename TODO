  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: k3b has minimization issues when burning cd's (it tries to unminimize
  its window and this doesn't work)
* BUG: openoffice 2 when ddisplaying a presentation with xinerama (multiple
  zones) weird things happen (the presentation doesnt display - it seemingly
  attaches to the 2nd zone, not the first), crashes have been reported too.
* BUG: dnd icon from window that has no .eap defining its ocon to ibar and the
  ibar icon ends up blank (cant build .eap freom ARGB pixels)
* BUG: edge flip for desktops still active if turned off when dragging a window
  off the desktop - either a separate config value (recommended) or turn it
  off for window dragging too
* BUG: desktop settings is missing preview
* BUG: modules need to destroy config dialogs on shutdown (otherwise - segv!)
* BUG: IBAR follower speed and autoscroll speed are not pixels / sec (they are
  recursive multiplication values). should invert gui valus and display as a
  factor, not px/sec
* BUG: changing border from shaped to not shaped produces shadow bugs
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)
* BUG: if a user selects a border the border should not just shange based on
  properties. if user selects a border in border selector, then lock border
* BUG: if you iconify a window and while iconified the window unmaps
  (rhythmbox does this a lot apparently) e doesnt realise and still thinks
  its iconified.
* BUG: dnd to ibar is broken if u did an icon that isn't IN the ibar yet
  (from a window border) to either the very start or end of the ibar.
* BUG: dnd from konqueror on zone 0 to another konq on zone 1 with xinerama (2
  zones) causes segv
* BUG: in general fullscreen needs work, cleaning and testing. dont allow
  desktop switches for the desk a fullscreened window is on, nor allow windows
  to be raised above the fs win etc. ie the app must seem to be entirely fs for
  that zone.
* BUG: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that wont fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2
* BUG: Hiding the label of e_widget_slider causes the slider line to disappear

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* when gadgets expand they should expand in a way to not overlap if possible
* implement thees maximise/fullscreen modes:
  Which of these should be different modes, and which should be options for
  a mode? i think they all should be distinct actions of their own bound
  to a key, button etc. which one of these the maximize button on a window
  will execute should be a configuration value though :)
  1. fullscreen (no border - resizes to default screen res). window is locked,
     no mouse bindings work. any focus change out of thsi window will go out of
     fullscreen  mode
  2. zoom (changes screen res to match window, or closest res thats bigger
     than the window, centers it - no borders/title etc). window is locked, no
     mouse bindings work. any focus change out of thsi window will go out of
     zoom  mode
  3. maximise (only title is displayed - program fills the rest of the screen)
     disable resize, shade, move etc. in this mode. iconify is ok.
  4. maximise2 (maximise window up to the edge of panels, gadgets etc. -
     disable all resizing and moving just like 1, 2 nd 3 (maybe make border
     thinner to indicate this). disable stuff like 3.
  5. expand (just resize window to fill the same space as 4. - but it still can
      be shaded, resized, moved etc.)
  6. fill (expand to the nearest window edge or screen edge)
  for 5 and 6 u want to able to do this independently for width and height as
  well as for both at once. for 1. & 2. if window max size (or aspect
  adjusted size) is smaller that screen max size, fill in space in between
  with black. for 3. we want to fill the inbewteen space with some theme
  defined image data
* actions to make current zone different (warp mouse to there)
* actions to make the current container different
* titlebar/border expansion/gadget panel for modules to put window widgets in
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* gadget containers (shelves?) using popups as well as in-line in a canvas
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir
* dnd from pager to other pagers/ to desktop/ibox etc.
* ibar should enable user to select different dirs to view per bar and allow
  new bars to be created or bars to be deleted
* ibar need to support label pop-ups
* ibar should support subdirs with pop-up icons...
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support text and color classes
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* make xrandr support get rotation and store it
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* EAP cache files can be hit and miss and have problems. move things to be
  explicit reloads.
* need to match EAPI on all fn's as well as thier prototypes
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* gadman needs some changes to virtualise the canvas/container the gadget
  ends up in (eg in popups or border)
* module api needs to move label and icon to data file (.eap file?), not api
* ibar lamp needs short timer on mouse out for hide before hiding (and del
  the time on mouse in)
* allow object paranoia to be a runtime option too

  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas has eet support early on.
