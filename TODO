MINI FREEZE:

Status: OFF

What is this:

We will have lots more of these during e17 devel for serveral reasons. A mini
freeze is a call to STOP adding new features and funkiness. It means people
need to stop and go BACK over their code and fix FIXME's. All those bits of
code where things are string together with sticky tape and chewing gum need
to be fixed PROPERLY. This may mean pooling code into a common subsystem
(this is not a new feature. it is fixing loose ends with design). This may
mean adding api calls to make implementation cleaner or remove hacks. it may
mean more debugging tools in things like e_object and more checks for sanity.

This means testing stuff so it doesnt crash. or make things unusable or leak
memory. check leaks (use valgrind or whatever tools) to check for leaks, and
for stability issues. double check you return the correct values from
functions or use return values. Check callbacks. Compile with -W -Wall to
help find obvious bugs waiting to happen. Modules need to clean up on
shutdown. Code needs to use the appropriate subsystem that is available for
what it wants OR a subsystem needs writing if it will be a shared/common
feature.

This issues list must be brought to 0 size before E17 features can move
further.

Current freeze issues are:

FIXME: group these TODO items into:

1. essential features
2. fixes
3. cleanups
4. optimisations
5. nice to have features



Some of the things (in very short form) that need to be done to E17...

Also look at all the .c files - they have their own localized TODO lists

These are in no particular order:

* add app execute action (execute eapp - not just exe line)
* add locale and encoding fields to eapp files (to launch eapp in that locale+encoding)
* add input method selector stuff to eapp - same as locale
* libechack needs to come back - and execute all things with libehack preloads active
* get all libehack properties if they exist
* titlebar/border expansion/gadget panel for moduels to put window widgets in
* add actions to flip desktops on a given zone and/or container only
* don't show borders before window
* double check edje and evas image caches are working
* breaking out config via ipc / e_remote is too much work. this needs to get
  easier.
* move all ipc codecs to use eet
* on restart e always goes back to desktop 0,0 - it shoudl go to the desktop
  it was last on (per zone, per container, per manager).
* start module needs to have an way to alert users to "click here" and back
  off alerting users as they learn what it is (over time)
* sometiems windows that get shut down/closed get unparented but the whole
  border stays around - something is keeping extra references maybe? it is
  hidden, until you flip desktops then it appears again - but with no client
  around.
* fix action delete (can segv if action is stored for "long runing actions"
  like move/resize)
* drop on ibar for re-ordering, removal seems broken (drop location is the
  wrong spot)
* break out desks x/y size config so you can have a different desktop size
  per zone - right now there is a signle global (use this later as the default
  for new/unconfigured zones)
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* perhaps we should split focus and "selected" windows. selected window is
  what ocused is now and focus is something only affectinbg keyboard input. if
  the focus window becoems another managed window it becoems the selected
  window - otherwise click to focus or pointer focus will chose the selected
  window that may get the focus if it allows it...
* check window max size. if < size of zone (or maximisation area) disallow
  maximising and tell border edje object (via signals) to somehow disable the
  maximise buttons :) (and remove from the menu)
* drag and drop need to center icon at correct offset based on mouse down
  before drag start
* bug: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that wont fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2
* gadman gadget menu needs icons :)
* module api needs to move label and icon to data file, not api
* gadman edit mode for simple gadgets activate with a button bind (eg
  alt+click on module like windows) or a pure key binding
* "start button" module to pop up the e menu (left mouse right now)
* click to focus
* make e17 re-locatable (ues environment var, or find out by hunting path
  argv[0] if its not a full path or munge the full path to the exe in argv[0])
* java apps seem to have a hard time if we dont pretend to be kwin
  (see e_hints.c) - get this stuff upstream to sun and get things fixed in
  java.
* gadget containers (shelves?)
* add key input focus control for desktop modules
* finish off icccm support
* optimize clock theme (speed/cpu) (rotation in edje???)
* add "icon box"
* add complete netwm support
* different cursors for different parts of the screen
* alt+tab popup list of windows
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir
* optimise client manage: list window properties then only fetch the ones
  that exist on window map
* non opaque move/resize
* ibar need to support label pop-ups
* ibar should support subdirs with pop-up icons...
* support dnd for ibar etc.
* borders need to be able to change border theme on the fly
* add window glueing
* add window tabs (multiple clients in 1 border)
* add setup/install wizard to seed eapp files etc. etc.
* make ipc try open on other ports numbers if current is taken
* make ipc try re-open if connection dies
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* add a button area expansion for borders ???
* add template button for expanded buttons ???
* add a status area expansion for borders ???
* add a status module template for borders ???
* support text and color classes
* add tooltips
* add fullscreen support (e16 xvidmode or xrandr style)
* add screen rotation info to managers (from xrandr)
* make xrandr support get rotation
* add rotation to containers
* fix multihead support (executing with DISPLAY=:0.1 on screen 1 for example)
* maybe add systray module/support?
* allow object paranoia to be a runtime option too
* add sliders, radio and check buttons for clientinfo pane
* add separate app menu bars at top of screen support
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* add really nice "about" box with theme, authors credits list etc etc.
* init splash needs te be able to be signalled "end of init" and it can
  respond with a "splash end" signal
* "immortal" windows (e will not allow that window to be closed or will
  refuse to exit as long as the immortal flags is set until it is unset to
  stop users from doing silly things like logging out while important stuff
  is happening in that window -a menu option for this woudl be nice)
* ibar lamp needs short timer on mouse out for hide before hiding (and del
  the time on mouse in)
* need to be able to remember client positons/etc.
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
* gui config tools for bg's, keybindings, etc. etc. etc.
* go through e16 features we dont have and implement the most useful ones (or
  re-design and implement)
* libehack from old e17 wrapper for executing apps
* use libehack stuff to track launches of apps etc.
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* make status modules (like cpu meter per window) use ehack to get pid to
  monitor it's cpu load
* modules need config executables with proper widgets (sliders, check boxes,
  radio etc. not massive menus)
* module control panel app
* remove module config menus (make them part of the module control panel and
  as separate executables)
* tip/hint/suggestion dialog app (textblock etc.)
* segv/restart handler like e16.
