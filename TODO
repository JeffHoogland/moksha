MINI FREEZE:

Status: OFF

What is this:

We will have lots more of these during e17 devel for serveral reasons. A mini
freeze is a call to STOP adding new features and funkiness. It means people
need to stop and go BACK over their code and fix FIXME's. All those bits of
code where things are string together with sticky tape and chewing gum need
to be fixed PROPERLY. This may mean pooling code into a common subsystem
(this is not a new feature. it is fixing loose ends with design). This may
mean adding api calls to make implementation cleaner or remove hacks. it may
mean more debugging tools in things like e_object and more checks for sanity.

This means testing stuff so it doesnt crash. or make things unusable or leak
memory. check leaks (use valgrind or whatever tools) to check for leaks, and
for stability issues. double check you return the correct values from
functions or use return values. Check callbacks. Compile with -W -Wall to
help find obvious bugs waiting to happen. Modules need to clean up on
shutdown. Code needs to use the appropriate subsystem that is available for
what it wants OR a subsystem needs writing if it will be a shared/common
feature.

This issues list must be brought to 0 size before E17 features can move
further.

Current freeze issues are:

Some of the things (in very short form) that need to be done to E17...

Also look at all the .c files - they have their own localized TODO lists

These are in no particular order:



1. essential features

* add fullscreen support (e16 xvidmode or xrandr style)
* implement thses maximise/fullscreen modes:
  Which of these should be different modes, and which should be options for
  a mode? i think they all should be distinct actions of their own bound
  to a key, button etc. which one of these the maximize button on a window
  will execute should be a configuration value though :)
  1. fullscreen (no border - resizes to default screen res). window is locked,
     no mouse bindings work. any focus change out of thsi window will go out of
     fullscreen  mode
  2. zoom (changes screen res to match window, or closest res thats bigger
     than the window, centers it - no borders/title etc). window is locked, no
     mouse bindings work. any focus change out of thsi window will go out of
     zoom  mode
  3. maximise (only title is displayed - program fills the rest of the screen)
     disable resize, shade, move etc. in this mode. iconify is ok.
  4. maximise2 (maximise window up to the edge of panels, gadgets etc. -
     disable all resizing and moving just like 1, 2 nd 3 (maybe make border
     thinner to indicate this). disable stuff like 3.
  5. expand (just resize window to fill the same space as 4. - but it still can
     be shaded, resized, moved etc.)
  6. fill (expand to the nearest window edge or screen edge)
  for 5 and 6 u want to able to do this independently for width and height as
  well as for both at once. for 1. & 2. if window max size (or aspect
  adjusted size) is smaller that screen max size, fill in space in between
  with black. for 3. we want to fill the inbewteen space with some theme
  defined image data
* implement a better dialog for things like "do you want to do X - yes or no?"
* dialogs for generic contents too
* tip/hint/suggestion dialog app (textblock etc.)
* netwm window types and states need addressing (do special/appropriate things)
  for each of them.
* netwm frame extents request (_e_manager_cb_frame_extents_request) needs
  to properly choose the border based on client window properties.
* do something with the icccm urgency field hint
* different borders for non-resizable windows, shaped windows etc.
* add bg transition effects like crossfade, zoom in / out etc...
* break out ipc to set names for desktops and zones
* window icons should be able to be chosen if e eapp icon overrides netwm
  icon or the other way around.
* eapps need to provide title matching too as well as name and class
* transients should have option to always follow parent
  (move/resize/raise/lower)
* actions to make current zone different (warp mouse to there)
* actions to make the current container different
* add locale and encoding fields to eapp files (to launch eapp in that
  locale+encoding)
* add input method selector stuff to eapp - same as locale
* titlebar/border expansion/gadget panel for modules to put window widgets in
* add actions to flip desktops on a given zone and/or container only
* break out desks x/y size config so you can have a different desktop size
  per zone - right now there is a signle global (use this later as the default
  for new/unconfigured zones)
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* check window max size. if < size of zone (or maximisation area) disallow
  maximising and tell border edje object (via signals) to somehow disable the
  maximise buttons :) (and remove from the menu) or center client in frame or
  something else to not exceed max size for window
* gadman gadget menu needs icons :)
* gadman edit mode for simple gadgets activate with a button bind (eg
  alt+click on module like windows) or a pure key binding
* gadget containers (shelves?) using popups as well as in-line in a canvas
* add key input focus control for desktop modules
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* make the cursors an edje buffer canvas for changinig cursor depending on
  context
* different cursors for different parts of the screen
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir
* ibar need to handle drop from other places (xdnd, drop from window etc.)
* dnd from pager to other pagers/ to desktop/ibox etc.
* ibar should enable user to select different dirs to view per bar and allow
  new bars to be created or bars to be deleted
* ibar need to support label pop-ups
* ibar should support subdirs with pop-up icons...
* ibar needs lamp follower to be optional in ibar config (for the user)
* borders need to be able to change border theme on the fly by mene or app
  properties
* add window glueing (i'm on it, so talk to me before doing any glue code -- rephorm)
* add setup/install wizard to seed eapp files etc. etc.
* make ipc try open on other ports numbers if current is taken
* make ipc try re-open if connection dies
* support text and color classes
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* add sliders, radio and check buttons for clientinfo pane
* add tooltips
* make xrandr support get rotation and store it
* add separate app menu bars at top of screen support
* add really nice "about" box with theme, authors credits list etc etc.
* "immortal" windows (e will not allow that window to be closed or will
  refuse to exit as long as the immortal flags is set until it is unset to
  stop users from doing silly things like logging out while important stuff
  is happening in that window -a menu option for this woudl be nice)
* need to be able to remember client positons/etc.
* with remember need to be able lock in attributes so the app (or user or both)
  cannot change them (eg this window is a fixed size and location - app cannot
  ask for a new size or location)
* gui config tools for bg's, keybindings, etc. etc. etc.
* "control panel" app to launch the gui config tools
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* modules need config executables with proper widgets (sliders, check boxes,
  radio etc. not massive menus)
* remove module config menus (make them part of the module control panel and
  as separate executables)
* actuallly break out ipc and config to set bg per desktop (per zone)

2. fixes

* need to hide other windows while doing fullscreen.
* bug: on font apply borders need to be adjuted for size changes
* bug: font apply doesnt seem to keep working (edje problem?) unless you
  restart
* bug: alt +click window (or just click its title) and start a move. if you
  flip desktop WHILE moving (with key binding) the window will follow but the
  pager doesnt update.
* bug: if you flip desktops while resizing resize should get aborted, not
  continue.
* bug: if i downlock my machine to like 400mhz (make it sloooow) or load it
  down with lots of load and then hold down ctrl+alt+right for a while
  windows on desktops vanish... there must be a race condition with a
  map/unmap event and something else... they still are around in x- just e
  hides them and never shows them again
* bug: resize of xmms playlist is broken when sizing up
* bug: this same bug can be seen resizing eclipse - it stays 1 event behind
* bug: quit app while in fullscreen black bg stays
* bug: if focus changes while in fullscreen, un-fullscreen the app and deal
  with focus
* pug?: pager problems. Seems to loose or mess up windows sometimes.
* bug?: xine's ui window/panel is under its video window when u go
  fullscreen. is this correct?
* bug: pager doesnt handle container/zone resize properly (and goes a weird
  size)??? (try resize screen to like 480x640 (new aspect))
* bug: sometimes the mouse gets locked to a window with a mouse grab of some
  sort in x (it gets the down event and not the up?) so e thinks its down but
  it isn't
* bug: maximised apps when e restarts are not recognised as maximised
* bug: sometimes windows that get shut down/closed get unparented but the whole
  border stays around - something is keeping extra references maybe? it is
  hidden, until you flip desktops then it appears again - but with no client
  around. currently they have a dangling reference - need to find out WHO
  added that ref and didnt remove it (i haven't seen this for ages now)
* bug: fix action delete (can segv if action is stored for "long runing actions"
  like move/resize)
* bug: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that wont fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2

3. cleanups

* make auto kill client and the kill() stuff config options
* make 10.0 sec ping time and the 10.0 sec wait for a SIGKILL an option
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* re-implement all ipc to go via e_ipc_handlers.h and e_ipc_codec.[ch]
* gadman needs some changes to virtualise the canvas/container the gadget
  ends up in (eg in popups or border)
* perhaps we should split focus and "selected" windows. selected window is
  what ocused is now and focus is something only affectinbg keyboard input. if
  the focus window becoems another managed window it becoems the selected
  window - otherwise click to focus or pointer focus will chose the selected
  window that may get the focus if it allows it...
* module api needs to move label and icon to data file (.eapp file?), not api
* make e17 re-locatable (ie use e_prefix.c stuff instead of #defined paths)
* ibar lamp needs short timer on mouse out for hide before hiding (and del
  the time on mouse in)
* allow object paranoia to be a runtime option too

4. optimisations

* could speedup dropshadow's gaussian blurr with mmx and sse by doign 2 or 4
  rows at once
* optimize clock theme (speed/cpu) (rotation in edje??? or evas???)

5. nice to have features

* "run command" typebuffer thing
* icons should be able to be overidden from the theme (eapp and menu stuff
  etc.)
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas has eet support early on.
* pagers should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
* start module needs to have a way to alert users to "click here" and back
  off alerting users as they learn what it is (over time)
* non opaque move/resize
* add window tabs (multiple clients in 1 border)
* add a button area expansion for borders ???
* add template button for expanded buttons ???
* maybe add systray module/support?
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
