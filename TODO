Some of the things (in very short form) that need to be done to E17...
(These are in no particular order)

  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: smart placement seems to screw up if a shelf is at the top of the screen
* BUG: e17 screen res diaolg doesnt work under xephyr - why?
* BUG: the ibar specific menu only shows when you right click on icons (and not
  on the bar itself). so, if there are no icons you can't get to the config.
  ibox also has this problem..related to the o_empty object not resizing when
  the module does.
* BUG: "match this window only" doesnt fall back to other unused remembers
* BUG: if app asks for borderless in properties - borderless toggle in menu
  doesn't have any effect.
* BUG: change exe name in basic mode in eap editor and icon vanishes (don't
  extract existing icon and write out to tmp .png while rebuilding).
* BUG: ghost windows happen if windows close when on another desktop or if
  windows are very short-lived
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)
* BUG: if you iconify a window and while iconified the window unmaps
  (rhythmbox does this a lot apparently) e doesnt realize and still thinks
  it's iconified.
* BUG: Hiding the label of e_widget_slider causes the slider line to disappear
* BUG: Transition config dialog needs preview.

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* fm2 needs way to replace or extend the right click menu (disable/enable
  rename/delete/refresh etc.)
* fm2 .desktop parser needs to handle i18n
* fm2 needs a mime filter
* fm2 needs to have a mime & filetype -> icon mapping
* eap editor is broken - segv in advanced mode
* middle mouse on gadgets as a quick move/resize thing?
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support color classes (gui config  etc. etc.)
* finish clientinfo dialog for borders (netwm props etc. etc.)
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* Window Border Icon > "Create Icon" needs to copy the ARGB icon data (into a 
  temp file?) and use that as the default icon.
* Dragging a non-eap icon from a border to the ibar should automatically
  create the icon and add that (instead of warning the user that this can't be
  done)
* new fm code re-lays-out a dir every time the queue is processed - maybe try
  to speed this up
* new fm code's file scanning isn't insanely fast - icon size calcs etc. speed
  up for special cases like list view?

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* desktop transitions with xinerama - are... weird. might stretch the anim to
use the whole container bounds.
* bg gradient dialog needs a preview widget. also edje needs to be updated so we can do proper fills for non 0 angles.
* clientinfo dialog could be nicer - then again it is an obsucre thing.
* desklock's pam profile should be configurable as system-auth doesn't
  always work and the fallback checks might not work either.
* If a user has set a border type on a window, don't bother to check for
  changes.
* keybindings dialog doesn't conform its formatting or datatype naming to
  anything else in e17 - it needs fixing.
* need to audit, namespace and expand text and color classes
* need to specify what is NEEDED from a  theme, what is  optional (in terms of
  parts, groups and signals). etc.
* default config for shelf is screwy and needs fixing - related to gadcon
  layout algorithm though.
* ipc is a mess. overgrown. hard to work with. what to do? remove?
* EAP cache files can be hit and miss and have problems. move things to be
  explicit reloads.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* e_color_dialog needs to have an area for favorite and recently selected colors. store in config and use ilist? or store as color files and use e_fm2? or custom widget?

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* full fm2 support as an icon fm needs work - beyond fsel needs and for icons
  on the desktop etc. etc.
* winlist and exebuf can let the mouse select items
* switch to desktop of a new window if it opens on another desktop than the
  current one (optional too)
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas engine can work on a given screen before using it
* non opaque move/resize
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
* improve drag/resize of gadget items
* pager should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
* add a dialog to allow selecting the default border from among those present
  in the theme (e.g. winter provides a 'square' border). after a theme change
  this should fall back to "default" if the selected one doesn't exist in the
  new theme.
