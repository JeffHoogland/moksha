  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: ghost windows happen if windows close when on another desktop or if
  windows are very short-lived
* BUG: k3b has minimization issues when burning cds (it tries to unminimize
  its window and this doesn't work)
* BUG: openoffice 2 when displaying a presentation with xinerama (multiple
  zones) weird things happen (the presentation doesnt display - it seemingly
  attaches to the 2nd zone, not the first), crashes have been reported too.
* BUG: dnd icon from window that has no .eap defining its icon to ibar and the
  ibar icon ends up blank (can't build .eap from ARGB pixels)
* BUG: modules need to destroy config dialogs on shutdown (otherwise - segv!)
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)
* BUG: if a user selects a border the border should not just change based on
  properties. if user selects a border in border selector, then lock border
* BUG: if you iconify a window and while iconified the window unmaps
  (rhythmbox does this a lot apparently) e doesnt realize and still thinks
  it's iconified.
* BUG: in general fullscreen needs work, cleaning and testing. dont allow
  desktop switches for the desk a fullscreened window is on, nor allow windows
  to be raised above the fs win etc. ie the app must seem to be entirely fs for
  that zone.
* BUG: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that won't fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2
* BUG: Hiding the label of e_widget_slider causes the slider line to disappear

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir (and dnd from it into ibar etc.)
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support color classes (gui config  etc. etc.)
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* shelf gui config needs a basic mode that is simpler and current becomes
  "advanced" mode.

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ipc is a mess. overgrown. hard to work with. what to do? remove?
* EAP cache files can be hit and miss and have problems. move things to be
  explicit reloads.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* option to allow flipping desktops to wrap at virtual desktop grid edges
* window menu with raise/lower for windows (obviously missing currently)
* ibox should have options "Show from this desktop", "Show from all desktops",
  "show from zones", "show from this zone", etc. Similarly to those, that are 
  in winlist.
* winlist and exebuf can let the mouse select items
* option to NOT raise on focus in click to focus
* switch to desktop of a new window if it opens on another desktop than the
  current one
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check engine can work on a given screen before using it
* non opaque move/resize
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
* "disable this gadget" menu option on gadcon clients
* improve drag/resize of gadget items
* pager should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
