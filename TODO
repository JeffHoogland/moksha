Some of the things (in very short form) that need to be done to E17...

Also look at all the .c files - they have their own localized TODO lists

These are in no particular order:

* fix border raise/lower to use certain marker "windows" to not raise above or lower below (menus should always be above the top marker window for example)
* fix focus handling (qt apps, openoffice, etc. etc.)
* track mouse location on a border/desktop level
* add desktop object/element management interface (sanitise module hell there)
* add key input focus control for desktop modules
* finish off icccm support
* optimize clock theme (speed/cpu)
* make shading go in all 4 directions
* add virtual desktops
* add keybindings
* add general actions to be hooked to button/key bindings
* add "icon box"
* add iconify (minimize)

* full colour+alpha cursors
* different cursors for different parts of the screen
* alt+tab status list of windows
* add a "taskbar"

* make root menus configurable (what mouse/key brings up what)
* add favorites apps menu items for editing (at the bottom or such)
* add a way to access all apps

* add xrandr support
* fix multihead support
* xinerama support

* fix all loose ends
* allow object paranoia to be a runtim option too
* detect segv and report it (maybe turn on obj paranoia)
* add sliders, radio and check buttons for clientinfo pane
* display coords while moving/resizing
* add separate app menu bars at top of screen support
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc. that overlay the screen
* add really nice "about" box with theme, authors credits list etc etc.
