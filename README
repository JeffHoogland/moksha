Enlightenment 0.17.0

Requirements:
-------------

Must:
  libc libm libX11 libXext evas ecore ecore-evas ecore-file ecore-ipc ecore-con
  ecore-imf ecore-x edje eet embryo efreet e_dbus eio
  xcb xcb-shape xcb-keysyms
  [png loader in evas, jpeg loader in evas, eet loader in evas, software_x11
  engine in evas, buffer engine in evas]

NOTE: Users of DR16 will need to rename the $prefix/bin/enlightenment
file prior to installing DR17 or it will be overwritten.

You can also use the configure --prefix option to put e17 in a separate tree
of its own (recommended) like:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/e17

You will, as usual, need to add the subsequent bin dir to your $PATH etc.


NOTES:

* do NOT use -mfpmath=sse in CFLAGS - we are not sure, but it may have bugs
and screws up things in edje, evas and e17. if your gcc uses this by default
(which apparently gcc4.x does on amd64), turn it off with a -fpmath=387 in
your CFLAGS.

* your freetype2 version must be > 2.1.7

* if you do not want security issues make sure sysactions.conf is in
/etc/enlightenment (not PREFIX/etc/enlightenment) as this is the first place
it looks at. This file is intended to be customized by packagers and
system integrators to match your policies and scripts/tools.
